# Usage

The project is meant to be an example, used to find out how to set up a Spring-based web service, so its main usage is being examined and used as a base for other projects.

Still, it can be packaged and run in a server, both to show that it actually works and to allow any additional test which may be required.

As this is a Maven project which comes with the Jetty plugin, running the project means just using the following command:

```
$ mvn clean package jetty:run-war
```
