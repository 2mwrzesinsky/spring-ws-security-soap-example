/**
 * Client for querying the web service.
 * <p>
 * The only operation supported is querying an endpoint by sending an entity's
 * id, and receiving back that entity's data.
 * <p>
 * As with the endpoint, this client is unsecured. Any security concern is to be
 * taken care by Spring. This means that by default it will only be able to
 * query unsecure endpoints.
 * <p>
 * Some security protocols, such as encryption, may make endpoints unreachable.
 * To solve this a {@link SoapActionCallback} will be used by the client when
 * querying.
 * <p>
 * If any of the usual SOAP or transmission problems arise, the client will
 * throw an exception. But if for any reason there is no error but no response
 * is received, or an empty one is received, then a {@code null} value will be
 * returned.
