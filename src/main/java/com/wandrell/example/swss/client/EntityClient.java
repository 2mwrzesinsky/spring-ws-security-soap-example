/**
 * Client for acquiring entities from the web service.
 * <p>
 * The client only handles the JAXB classes created from the XSD fiel, and not
 * the domain model classes.
 * <p>
 * The only operation supported is querying an endpoint by sending an entity's
 * id, receiving back that entity's data.
 * <p>
 * Internally a {@link SoapActionCallback} will be used when calling the web
 * service to avoid the problems caused by some security protocols, mostly
 * encryption, which may make the endpoints unreachable.
 * <p>
 * If any of the usual SOAP or transmission problems arise, the client will
 * throw an exception. But if for any reason there is no error but no response
 * is received, or an empty one is received, then a {@code null} value will be
 * returned.
